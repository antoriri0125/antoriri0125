Please interact with caution as I had a problematic past, so there will be times when I don't act friendly.

Feel free to interact unless said otherwise (May have DNIUF/DNIUCF labeled in my name sometimes for personal reasons.)

If you wanna become friends, please tell me so I can send you a friend request. (my friend requests are disabled. keep in mind I unfriend people after a while of no interaction)

If I'm sleeping that indicates that I'm AFK or offtab at the moment, so it's best to whisper me at this time

I have mild dementia and I constantly forget who people are unless I see them occasionally, please remind me who you are if we've met/interacted before

I'm a complex person and I'm not easy to become friends with, so please be cautious with me as I have a disorganized attachment style. (I get very comfortable and talkative with my close/best friends so if I act like this around you, congrats bud you're one of my BEST pals!!)

Keep in mind that whether you see me as a chronically online person or not, remember that I'm a human being and my boundaries matter. So please  go away or stop when I ask you to.

I get very overwhelmed when I'm talking to a lot of people at the same time, so I may become nonverbal if it's too much to handle
